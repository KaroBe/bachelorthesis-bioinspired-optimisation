  abstract   = {A unified view of metaheuristics This book provides a complete background on metaheuristics and shows readers how to design and implement efficient algorithms to solve complex optimization problems across a diverse range of applications, from networking and bioinformatics to engineering design, routing, and scheduling. It presents the main design questions for all families of metaheuristics and clearly illustrates how to implement the algorithms under a software framework to reuse both the design and code. Throughout the book, the key search components of metaheuristics are considered as a toolbox for:  Designing efficient metaheuristics (e.g. local search, tabu search, simulated annealing, evolutionary algorithms, particle swarm optimization, scatter search, ant colonies, bee colonies, artificial immune systems) for optimization problems  Designing efficient metaheuristics for multi-objective optimization problems   Designing hybrid, parallel, and distributed metaheuristics   Implementing metaheuristics on sequential and parallel machines   Using many case studies and treating design and implementation independently, this book gives readers the skills necessary to solve large-scale optimization problems quickly and efficiently. It is a valuable reference for practicing engineers and researchers from diverse areas dealing with optimization or machine learning; and graduate students in computer science, operations research, control, engineering, business and management, and applied mathematics.},

  abstract     = {Because of successful implementations and high intensity, metaheuristic research has been extensively reported in literature, which covers algorithms, applications, comparisons, and analysis. Though, little has been evidenced on insightful analysis of metaheuristic performance issues, and it is still a ``black box'' that why certain metaheuristics perform better on specific optimization problems and not as good on others. The performance related analyses performed on algorithms are mostly quantitative via performance validation metrics like mean error, standard deviation, and co-relations have been used. Moreover, the performance tests are often performed on specific benchmark functions---few studies are those which involve real data from scientific or engineering optimization problems. In order to draw a comprehensive picture of metaheuristic research, this paper performs a survey of metaheuristic research in literature which consists of 1222 publications from year 1983 to 2016 (33 years). Based on the collected evidence, this paper addresses four dimensions of metaheuristic research: introduction of new algorithms, modifications and hybrids, comparisons and analysis, and research gaps and future directions. The objective is to highlight potential open questions and critical issues raised in literature. The work provides guidance for future research to be conducted more meaningfully that can serve for the good of this area of research.},

They are partly based on random and partly based on deterministic principles. Due to this nature, it is challenging to predict and control its performance in solving complex nonlinear problems. Recently, the study of evolutionary dynamics is focused not only on the traditional investigations but also on the understanding and analyzing new principles, with the intention of controlling and utilizing their properties and performances toward more effective real-world applications. In this book, based on many years of intensive research of the authors, is proposing novel ideas about advancing evolutionary dynamics towards new phenomena including many new topics, even the dynamics of equivalent social networks. In fact, it includes more advanced complex networks and incorporates them with the CMLs (coupled map lattices), which are usually used for spatiotemporal complex systems simulation and analysis, based on the observation that chaos in CML can be controlled, so does evolution dynamics. All the chapter authors are, to the best of our knowledge, originators of the ideas mentioned above and researchers on evolutionary algorithms and chaotic dynamics as well as complex networks, who will provide benefits to the readers regarding modern scientific research on related subjects.},

  abstract   = {Computational Intelligence (CI) bezeichnet ein Teilgebiet der Künstlichen Intelligenz, das biologische inspirierte Modelle algorithmisch umsetzt. Evolutionäre Algorithmen orientieren sich an der darwinistischen Evolution und suchen mit Hilfe von Crossover, Mutation und Selektion eine optimale Lösung. Die Fuzzy-Logik ermöglicht als unscharfe Logik eine kognitive Modellierung von Wissen und Inferenzprozessen. Neuronale Netze imitieren funktionale Aspekte des Gehirns für Aufgaben wie Klassifikation und Mustererkennung. Neuere Ansätze der CI wie Reinforcement Learning ermöglichen, das Verhalten künstlicher Agenten in unbekannten Umgebungen zu steuern. Die Schwarmintelligenz modelliert Algorithmen, die auf Basis vieler einfacher Komponenten intelligente Leistungen vollführen. Zu guter Letzt lösen künstliche Immunsysteme eine Reihe von Problemen, ähnlich wie ihr biologisches Pendant. Ein kompakter und übersichtlicher mit vielen Beispielen gespickter Einstieg in die verschiedenen Verfahren der CI.},

  abstract  = {Swarm intelligence (SI), an integral part in the field of artificial intelligence, is gradually gaining prominence, as more and more high complexity problems require solutions which may be sub-optimal but yet achievable within a reasonable period of time. Mostly inspired by biological systems, swarm intelligence adopts the collective behaviour of an organized group of animals, as they strive to survive. This study aims to discuss the governing idea, identify the potential application areas and present a detailed survey of eight SI algorithms. The newly developed algorithms discussed in the study are the insect-based algorithms and animal-based algorithms in minute detail. More specifically, we focus on the algorithms inspired by ants, bees, fireflies, glow-worms, bats, monkeys, lions and wolves. The inspiration analyses on these algorithms highlight the way these algorithms operate. Variants of these algorithms have been introduced after the inspiration analysis. Specific areas for the application of such algorithms have also been highlighted for researchers interested in the domain. The study attempts to provide an initial understanding for the exploration of the technical aspects of the algorithms and their future scope by the academia and practice.},

  abstract     = {Abstract In recent years, the field of combinatorial optimization has witnessed a true tsunami of “novel” metaheuristic methods, most of them based on a metaphor of some natural or man-made process. The behavior of virtually any species of insects, the flow of water, musicians playing together – it seems that no idea is too far-fetched to serve as inspiration to launch yet another metaheuristic. In this paper, we will argue that this line of research is threatening to lead the area of metaheuristics away from scientific rigor. We will examine the historical context that gave rise to the increasing use of metaphors as inspiration and justification for the development of new methods, discuss the reasons for the vulnerability of the metaheuristics field to this line of research, and point out its fallacies. At the same time, truly innovative research of high quality is being performed as well. We conclude the paper by discussing some of the properties of this research and by pointing out some of the most promising research avenues for the field of metaheuristics.},

  abstract    = {Theoretical analyses of stochastic search algorithms, albeit few, have always existed since these algorithms became popular. Starting in the nineties a systematic approach to analyse the performance of stochastic search heuristics has been put in place. This quickly increasing basis of results allows, nowadays, the analysis of sophisticated algorithms such as population-based evolutionary algorithms, ant colony optimisation and artificial immune systems. Results are available concerning problems from various domains including classical combinatorial and continuous optimisation, single and multi-objective optimisation, and noisy and dynamic optimisation. This chapter introduces the mathematical techniques that are most commonly used in the runtime analysis of stochastic search heuristics. Careful attention is given to the very popular artificial fitness levels and drift analyses techniques for which several variants are presented. To aid the reader's comprehension of the presented mathematical methods, these are applied to the analysis of simple evolutionary algorithms for artificial example functions. The chapter is concluded by providing references to more complex applications and further extensions of the techniques for the obtainment of advanced results.},

In the hybrid algorithm, each solution corresponds to a food source, which composes of two components, i.e., the routing component and the scheduling component. Each component is filled with discrete values. A crossover operator is developed for the employed bees to learn valuable information from each other. An external Pareto archive set is designed to record the non-dominated solutions found so far. A fast Pareto set update function is introduced in the algorithm. Several local search approaches are designed to balance the exploration and exploitation capability of the algorithm. Experimental results on the well-known benchmark instances and comparisons with other recently published algorithms show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

But when the solution space of the problem is discrete, the basic ABC algorithm should be modified to solve this class optimization problem. In this study, we focused on analysis of discrete ABC with neighborhood operator for well-known traveling salesman problem and different discrete neighborhood operators are replaced with solution updating equations of the basic ABC. Experimental computations show that the promising results are obtained by the discrete version of the basic ABC and which neighborhood operator is better than the others. Also, the results obtained by discrete ABC were enriched with 2- and 3-opt heuristic approaches in order to increase quality of the solutions.},

The other one is an improved version of CABC algorithm, called quick CABC (qCABC) algorithm. In order to see the efficiency of the new versions, 15 different TSP benchmarks are considered and the results generated are compared with different well-known optimization methods.

  abstract     = {Computational experiments show that the greedy algorithm (GR) and the nearest neighbor algorithm (NN), popular choices for tour construction heuristics, work at acceptable level for the Euclidean TSP, but produce very poor results for the general Symmetric and Asymmetric TSP (STSP and ATSP). We prove that for every n⩾2 there is an instance of ATSP (STSP) on n vertices for which GR finds the worst tour. The same result holds for NN. We also analyze the repetitive NN (RNN) that starts NN from every vertex and chooses the best tour obtained. We prove that, for the ATSP, RNN always produces a tour, which is not worse than at least n/2−1 other tours, but for some instance it finds a tour, which is not worse than at most n−2 other tours, n⩾4. We also show that, for some instance of the STSP on n⩾4 vertices, RNN produces a tour not worse than at most 2n−3 tours. These results are in sharp contrast to earlier results by Gutin and Yeo, and Punnen and Kabadi, who proved that, for the ATSP, there are tour construction heuristics, including some popular ones, that always build a tour not worse than at least (n−2)! tours.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces the ant colony system (ACS), a distributed algorithm that is applied to the traveling salesman problem (TSP). In the ACS, a set of cooperating agents called ants cooperate to find good solutions to TSPs. Ants cooperate using an indirect form of communication mediated by a pheromone they deposit on the edges of the TSP graph while building solutions. We study the ACS by running experiments to understand its operation. The results show that the ACS outperforms other nature-inspired algorithms such as simulated annealing and evolutionary computation, and we conclude comparing ACS-3-opt, a version of the ACS augmented with a local search procedure, to some of the best performing algorithms for symmetric and asymmetric TSPs.},
